Covid Vaccine Tracker is a **Web App** inspired by [kartikey54/VaccineAvailabilityNotifier](https://github.com/kartikey54/VaccineAvailabilityNotifier). It can lookup available appointments several days in advance for multiple pincodes. And if you don't have any available vaccination slots in your vicinity, the app can lookup 5 nearest pincodes and then perform vaccination slot search in those pincodes.
